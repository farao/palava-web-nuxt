        <h2>Connection Type</h2>
        <p>
          There are two different ways in which you can connect to someone via palava.tv:
        </p>
        <br/>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Direct:</strong> Your device is directly connected to the other device</li>
          <li><strong>Relayed:</strong> Both devices send their data to a relay server. This is sometimes necessary to successfully enable the connection. The relay server has no access to the data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Remote &amp; Local IPs</h2>
        <p>
          In order to establish a working connection, both parties send all their IP addresses to each other, including ones from your local network.
        </p>
        <p>
          IP addresses can come in IPv4 format (X.X.X.X) or IPv6 format (X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X).
